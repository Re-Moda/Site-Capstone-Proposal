# Reflection #2

Pod Members: **Paola Negron, Sarvesh Tiku, Liliana Cantero**

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were successfully able to generate our outfits on an avatar utilizing the OPEN AI API, render our maps for the thrift store api, and finish up the last of our routes for the incentivization feature.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We faced lot's of merge conflicts, but we were able to surpass them. The prompting for the open ai api has also been challenging, but we've been able to learn how to be more specific with our prompting.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 The main thing is we still need to connect our backend routes for the coins so that the count is reflected on the front end thrift store page. But we should be able to connect that route by the end of the day or over the weekend.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Our weekly pod sync with our mentors and referencing our instructors for help truly helped us plan and execute our capstone project this week. Their feedback is always essential to helping us reflect deeply on our project structure, and improve where we may be lacking. Our weekly demos with our peers and instructors also helps us with our soft skill of presenting and getting feedback for our user flow, interface, and overall design. We really appreciate everyones input and our ability to take that advice really showed during our demo this week as stated by our peers and instructors.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 The avatar image generation could be classified as at risk for us. We have been working on keeping the generation consistent, but must continue to test out our specific prompting to ensure consistency, quality, and sensitivity.
