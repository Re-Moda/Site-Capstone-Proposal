## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Met with a lead UX/UI designer who gave us feedback on our frontend and project idea.
 Made significant progress on the frontend and backend, which we are hoping to connect over the weekend!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Feeling unproductive at times and not reaching our goals on the exact timeline we wanted to. However, we are definitely still on track with meeting our end goal which we are pleased about.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 I believe we may have 2 cards on our Trello board that we did not get to, which deal with connecting the front end to the back end, but we are hoping to bridge that gap soon by prioritizing that over the weekend. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 One resource we found very helpful was the lecture on testing using SuperTest and JEST led by our lead instructor Alex. It helped us realize the reliability testing, bring it up during our weekly pod sync as a talking point to our mentors to further fortify the importance of testing and how it is used on the industry level, and how we should lay it out in regards to our current Sprint plan.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 I believe we did a good job at outlining our MVP p0 & p1's so that we truly have the most minimal viable product with little room for hiccups. Of course this means that we have put alot of our initial ideas on the back burner, but we plan to use them to our advantage during our presentation to sell our idea and vision to our audience further.
