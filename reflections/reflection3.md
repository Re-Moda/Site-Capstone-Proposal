## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 A successful thing from this week was finishing up all of our core features and presenting within a good range of the alloted time we had for our presentation.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges we faced were refactoring changes due to misaligned versions and connecting all of our changes together whilst trying to avoid or manage merge conflicts. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, thankfully we did! Despite our setbacks, we were able to overcome them together, even with the impending deadline of the code freeze for our project and the nerves from the idea of presenting. But, as always, we know we will pull through together as a team.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes! Our instructors and peers really are the best resources for help and advice. To add on, the connection between us individually with our mentors and our mentors with our pod sync groups have been engaging and very helpful with the exeution of our project and the conceptualization of the industry.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Thankfully, we believe we have hit every user story we had planned! We just need to figure out how to incorporate and focus on one throughout our presentation which we have acknowledged and will continue to tackle in the coming days.
